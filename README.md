# socAlytics

socAlytics is a planned polyglot monorepo. The repository currently contains
its governance and documentation foundation, a source-area scaffold, and the
first executable .NET platform host. Further product components will be added
through approved changes.

## Repository Structure

- [`src/platform/`](src/platform/README.md) contains the executable control-plane
    platform host and its ownership guidance.
- [`src/clients/`](src/clients/README.md) records the planned Web UI and Electron
    Coach Client ownership boundary.
- [`src/agents/`](src/agents/README.md) records the planned intelligence-agent
    runtime and tooling ownership boundary.
- [`src/analysts/`](src/analysts/README.md) records the planned Analyst Manager,
    Analyst SDK, and Analyst capability ownership boundary.
- [`docs/`](docs/README.md) indexes architecture, component, and operational documentation.
- [`.specify/`](.specify/memory/constitution.md) holds the Spec Kit project
    constitution, templates, and helper scripts; `.github/skills/speckit-*`
    holds the generated Spec Kit skills for GitHub Copilot.
- `specs/` holds one numbered folder per Spec Kit feature once the first
    feature is specified.
- [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) defines repository guidance for coding agents.
- [`LICENSE`](LICENSE) contains the project license.
- `.editorconfig` provides stack-neutral text-file defaults.

The clients, agents, and analysts source areas remain non-executable ownership
scaffolds. The platform area contains the repository's current application
projects and tests. No deployment manifests or product automation exist yet.

## Development

### Platform Host

The platform uses the .NET 10 SDK. Run these commands from the repository root:

```powershell
dotnet restore src/platform/SocAlytics.Platform.slnx
dotnet build src/platform/SocAlytics.Platform.slnx --no-restore
dotnet test src/platform/SocAlytics.Platform.slnx --no-build
dotnet run --project src/platform/SocAlytics.Platform.AppHost
```

The current executable evidence covers the ASP.NET Core API and Aspire AppHost,
liveness at `/alive`, readiness at `/health`, the `v1` OpenAPI document at
`/openapi/v1.json`, six capability composition boundaries, and focused host and
architecture tests.

Domain behavior, PostgreSQL persistence with Dapper and DbUp, NATS messaging,
S3-compatible storage, identity and authentication, client applications,
Docker support, and production deployment remain deferred. This executable
host scaffold does not claim production readiness.

### Spec Kit

Features are developed with [GitHub Spec Kit](https://github.com/github/spec-kit)
`1.0.13`, set up for GitHub Copilot in skills mode with Python helper scripts.
The project constitution in
[`.specify/memory/constitution.md`](.specify/memory/constitution.md) governs
every specification, plan, and task list.

Using the committed skills in GitHub Copilot needs only Python 3.11+ on `PATH`
as `python`. The `specify` CLI is needed only to upgrade Spec Kit or add
extensions. It requires [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) and is installed from
the pinned release tag:

```powershell
uv tool install specify-cli --from git+https://github.com/github/spec-kit.git@v1.0.13
specify version
```

When PyPI is reachable only through a package proxy, pass it to uv with
`--index-url <proxy-simple-url>`, because uv does not read pip's configuration.

Run the skills in GitHub Copilot Chat, one at a time, reviewing each result:

1. `/speckit-specify <what and why>` creates `specs/<NNN>-<feature>/spec.md`.
2. `/speckit-clarify` (optional) resolves ambiguities before planning.
3. `/speckit-plan <technical direction>` creates the plan and design artifacts
    and checks them against the constitution.
4. `/speckit-tasks` creates `tasks.md`; `/speckit-analyze` (optional) checks
    cross-artifact consistency.
5. `/speckit-implement` executes the tasks; `/speckit-converge` reports
    remaining gaps. Repeat both until convergence reports completion.

`/speckit-checklist` generates quality checklists, `/speckit-constitution`
amends the constitution, and `/speckit-taskstoissues` turns tasks into GitHub
issues.

The skills under `.github/skills/speckit-*` and the files under `.specify/`
other than the constitution are managed by the `specify` CLI. Do not edit them
by hand; run `specify self check` to look for a newer release and follow the
[Spec Kit upgrade guide](https://github.github.io/spec-kit/upgrade.html) to
refresh them.

### Markdown

Markdown validation uses pinned global development tools and does not require
an application `package.json`:

```powershell
npm install --global markdownlint-cli2@0.23.3 markdown-link-check@3.15.0
```

Run the supported Markdown validation command from the repository root:

```powershell
node .github/scripts/check-markdown.mjs
```

The command runs Markdown diagnostics on repository-authored files and checks
repository-relative links in all tracked or unignored Markdown files. Spec Kit
generated skills (`.github/skills/speckit-*`) and templates (`.specify/templates/`)
are excluded from style rules because the `specify` CLI owns their formatting;
their links are still checked. External URLs are ignored so
validation does not depend on network availability or third-party uptime.
Its own tests run with:

```powershell
node --test .github/scripts/check-markdown.test.mjs
```
